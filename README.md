Demo
====

Check out the [demo](http://omphalos.github.io/earhorn/).  In a separate window, open [the test page](http://localhost:8000/test.html).  If you move your mouse around in the test page, you should see variable logging.  It should look like:

The variables should update in real-time.

Caveats
=======
This thing is super experimental and barely works.  Have fun :)
