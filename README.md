Demo
====

Check out the [demo](http://omphalos.github.io/earhorn/demo.html).

It's inspired by mr doob's excellent [htmleditor](http://www.mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/) (Although [phoria.js](https://github.com/kevinroast/phoria.js) has been kinder to me on mobile so I'm using that to render).

Caveats
=======
This thing is super experimental and barely works.  Have fun :)
